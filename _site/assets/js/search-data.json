    "content": "Q: How much does it cost to participate at COSMOS? . A: Attendence is free for all accepted participants. In addition, we aim to provide free accomodations and a generous travel stipend to as many participants as possible, contingent on funding. The allocation of these funds will be to prioritize a diverse and inclusive summer school. Q: Will I be able to participate online . A: We anticipate an in-person meeting, but have a contingency plan for an online workshop if meeting in person is not possible. Q: How do I get to Konstanz? . A: By Plane: The nearest airports are “Bodensee-Airport” in Friedrichshafen and Zürich Airport. From Zürich airport, you can take a train in the airport to Konstanz in 1 to 1.5hrs. By Train: “Bahnhof Konstanz” is the main train station. From there, you can take “Bus Nr. 9” to get to the University. Q: What skills or prior experience should I have in order to participate? . A: Although some basic background knowledge in elementary statistics (e.g., probability theory) and programming in R are required to master the technical skills, no prior experience with computational modeling is necessary. If you have any additional questions, please Contact Us . ",

    "content": "Today, we live in a massively interconnected and digitalized society that allows us to rapidly exchange information among huge numbers of genetically unrelated individuals. This level of connectivity is made possible by our capacity for integrating socially acquired information with our individual experiences in order to inform our reasoning and decision-making processes. Human social learning and our capacity for cumulatively innovating upon past solutions thus plays a central role in our ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Yet, in addition to the benefits, there are also emerging dangers and pitfalls of social learning mechanisms gone awry, such as the spread of misinformation and formation of echo-chambers, which are phenomena we are only beginning to understand. While human social learning is certainly distinct, there has also been a long-standing tradition of researchers studying collective behavior in non-human animals, with their own sophisticated vocabulary of theories and powerful predictive models. Yet, superficial gaps in terminologies and concepts used across human and non-human domains have made cross-disciplinary collaborations difficult. To better understand ourselves as human social learners, what is required is a unified language that allows us to engage in the quantitative and comparative study of social learning and collective intelligence observed across species. To address this gap, we propose a summer school dedicated to developing the skills needed to communicate with researchers of social and collective behavior from diverse fields, using computational models as a common language. Computational modeling is becoming both more important and widely used in behavioural sciences. However, the mathematical framework and computational skills necessary to tackle the interdisciplinary challenges of modeling collective behaviour are not always readily accessible to early career researchers. For our second iteration in 2023, we have invited an exciting new line-up of speakers across a diverse spectrum of approaches for modeling social and collective behavior in humans and animals. Some new concepts include communication (McCarthy et al,. 2021), coordination (Hawkins et al., 2022), the geometry of collective decision-making (Sridhar et al., 2021), and both agent-based models (Acerbi et al., 2023) and population-level dynamics of cultural transmission (Kandler &amp; Crema, 2019).
