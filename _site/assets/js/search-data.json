    "content": "Today, we live in a massively interconnected and digitalized society that allows us to rapidly exchange information among huge numbers of genetically unrelated individuals. This level of connectivity is made possible by our capacity for integrating socially acquired information with our individual experiences in order to inform our reasoning and decision-making processes. Human social learning and our capacity for cumulatively innovating upon past solutions thus plays a central role in our ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Yet, in addition to the benefits, there are also emerging dangers and pitfalls of social learning mechanisms gone awry, such as the spread of misinformation and formation of echo-chambers, which are phenomena we are only beginning to understand. While human social learning is certainly distinct, there has also been a long-standing tradition of researchers studying collective behavior in non-human animals, with their own sophisticated vocabulary of theories and powerful predictive models. Yet, superficial gaps in terminologies and concepts used across human and non-human domains have made cross-disciplinary collaborations difficult. To better understand ourselves as human social learners, what is required is a unified language that allows us to engage in the quantitative and comparative study of social learning and collective intelligence observed across species. To address this gap, we propose a summer school dedicated to developing the skills needed to communicate with researchers of social and collective behavior from diverse fields, using computational models as a common language. Computational modeling is becoming both more important and widely used in behavioural sciences. However, the mathematical framework and computational skills necessary to tackle the interdisciplinary challenges of modeling collective behaviour are not always readily accessible to early career researchers.

Dr Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin is a research group leader jointly affiliated with the MPI-AB Ecology of Animal Societies Department and the University of Konstanz Biology Department. Her work focuses on revealing the mechanisms and consequences of collective behavior in biological and social systems. She is especially interested in understanding how animal groups make collective decisions and coordinate collective action, and in particular how these processes are affected by the social relationships between group members and the communication strategies they employ. Her group works across a range of study systems to tackle these questions, in close collaboration with researchers across a variety of disciplines. This lecture will give an overview of some of her work which aims to understand how animal and human groups make decisions in a group context, and how their interactions allow them to come to consensus on collective decisions. The talk will span a range of study species, and will highlight a few key methodological approaches that can be used to tackle these questions. Keywords: consensus decisions; collective animal movement; tracking; step selection model . Elena Miu . elena_miu[at]eva.mpg[dot]de . Dr Elena Miu is a cultural evolutionist interested in understanding the dynamics of cultural change across domains. Her work focuses on understanding cumulative cultural evolution using theoretical models and large-scale data. In her lecture, she will introduce a unique model of cumulative cultural evolution that allows us to study the drivers and dynamics of this phenomenon, as well as talk about an agent-based model she developed to investigate how cognitive learning mechanisms interact with task difficulty to shape cultural transmission in a complex cultural task. Keywords: Cumulative cultural evolution; innovation; recombination . Mark Ho . mark.ho.cs[at]gmail[dot]com . Dr Mark K Ho is a postdoctoral researcher in the Psychology and Computer Science departments at Princeton University. His research combines ideas from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence to examine how meta-reasoning—the capacity to reason about and influence mental states—shapes everyday thought, action, and interaction. In his lecture, he will address an outstanding question: How can we develop concise, interpretable models that integrate inference, decision-making, and interaction between multiple agents and their shared environment over time? He will discuss work that studies human planning and interactive communication by building on formalisms such as reinforcement learning, automated planning, and probabilistic programming. Keywords: planning, communication, theory of mind, meta-cognition, reinforcement learning . Natalia Vélez . nvelez[at]fas.harvard[dot]edu . Dr Natalia Vélez is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and an incoming assistant professor at Princeton University beginning in fall 2023. Her research examines the cognitive foundations of human collaboration at two scales: how individuals learn from and about their collaborators, and how communities self-organize for effective collaboration. In her talk, Natalia will review recent evidence that suggests that humans are not merely passive recipients of social information—rather, we can actively interpret others’ observable actions by reasoning about the unobservable mental states that produced them. This reasoning process can be formalized as probabilistic inference over a generative model of other minds. The talk will provide an overview of probabilistic models of social learning and will highlight key methodological issues in applying these models to understand human behavior. Keywords: theory of mind, Bayesian models, social learning . Ralf Kurvers . kurvers[at]mpib-berlin.mpg[dot]de . Dr Ralf Kurvers is the head of the research area Collective Intelligence at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and an external PI at the Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster. His work focuses on social and collective decision-making in human and non-human animals, combining both empirical and modeling approaches to unravel the cognitive mechanisms underlying individuals’ decision making in social contexts, and emerging collective dynamics. In his lecture, he will introduce a social drift–diffusion model that his team developed to capture dynamics of information cascades among interactive agents. Testing the model in human groups, he will show that the model can recover the dynamics of human social decision-making process, accurately capturing how individuals integrate personal and social information dynamically over time. Keywords: collective dynamics, evidence accumulation, drift diffusion models . Stefano Palminteri . stefano.palminteri[at]gmail[dot]com . Dr Stefano Palminteri is the head of the Human Reinforcement Learning team, at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris. His team investigates the computational mechanisms underlying goal-directed and value-based behaviors through the lens of reinforcement learning theory. Most of his recent studies involve behavioral testing and computational modeling and identify biases in human reinforcement learning. In his lecture, he will talk about the computational bases of imitation in simple reinforcement learning contexts, contrasting two main hypothesis decision-biasing and value-shaping. Behavioral data were overall consistent with the value-shaping hypothesis, but also showed that participants downregulate imitation when disadvantageous. Such a meta-learning effect was efficiently captured by a similarity based modulation of the imitation rate. In a subsequent simulation study, his team investigated the normative properties (the “blessing”) of value-shaping imitation over decision-biasing and identified scenarios where it is detrimental (the “curse”).
