    "content": "The Computational Summer school on Modeling Social and collective behavior (COSMOS) is designed to provide attendees (COSMOnauts) from diverse fields (e.g., psychology, economics, neuroscience, biology, computer science, etc…) and career stages (master, PhD, postdoc, and junior PI) with the computational skills required to tackle emerging challenges in understanding social learning and collective behaviour. Taking advantage of the close collaboration networks and interdisciplinary expertise available at the Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour (CASCB) in Konstanz, COSMOS will invite leading researchers from diverse disciplines as guest instructors who will mentor attendees’ own modelling projects during the School. In addition to providing hands-on instruction and mentorship for in-person attendees, our proposed hybrid format will also allow any number of remote participants to benefit from the openly accessible teaching materials and recorded talks. The goal of the students will be to develop a foundational understanding about how computational modeling can be a strong thread that unifies and advances the study of a wide range of social and collective phenomena.

Dr Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin is a research group leader jointly affiliated with the MPI-AB Ecology of Animal Societies Department and the University of Konstanz Biology Department. Her work focuses on revealing the mechanisms and consequences of collective behavior in biological and social systems. She is especially interested in understanding how animal groups make collective decisions and coordinate collective action, and in particular how these processes are affected by the social relationships between group members and the communication strategies they employ. Her group works across a range of study systems to tackle these questions, in close collaboration with researchers across a variety of disciplines. This lecture will give an overview of some of her work which aims to understand how animal and human groups make decisions in a group context, and how their interactions allow them to come to consensus on collective decisions. The talk will span a range of study species, and will highlight a few key methodological approaches that can be used to tackle these questions. Keywords: consensus decisions; collective animal movement; tracking; step selection model . Elena Miu . elena_miu[at]eva.mpg[dot]de . Dr Elena Miu is a cultural evolutionist interested in understanding the dynamics of cultural change across domains. Her work focuses on understanding cumulative cultural evolution using theoretical models and large-scale data. In her lecture, she will introduce a unique model of cumulative cultural evolution that allows us to study the drivers and dynamics of this phenomenon, as well as talk about an agent-based model she developed to investigate how cognitive learning mechanisms interact with task difficulty to shape cultural transmission in a complex cultural task. Keywords: Cumulative cultural evolution; innovation; recombination . Iain Couzin . icouzin[at]ab.mpg[dot]de . Professor Iain Couzin is Director of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, Department of Collective Behaviour and the Chair of Biodiversity and Collective Behaviour at the University of Konstanz, Germany and Previously he was a Full Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University, and prior to that a Royal Society University Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, and a Junior Research Fellow in the Sciences at Balliol College, Oxford. His work aims to reveal the fundamental principles that underlie evolved collective behavior, and consequently his research includes the study of a wide range of biological systems, from insect swarms to fish schools and primate groups. Mark Ho . mark.ho.cs[at]gmail[dot]com . Dr Mark K Ho is a postdoctoral researcher in the Psychology and Computer Science departments at Princeton University. His research combines ideas from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence to examine how meta-reasoning—the capacity to reason about and influence mental states—shapes everyday thought, action, and interaction. In his lecture, he will address an outstanding question: How can we develop concise, interpretable models that integrate inference, decision-making, and interaction between multiple agents and their shared environment over time? He will discuss work that studies human planning and interactive communication by building on formalisms such as reinforcement learning, automated planning, and probabilistic programming. Keywords: planning, communication, theory of mind, meta-cognition, reinforcement learning . Natalia Vélez . nvelez[at]fas.harvard[dot]edu . Dr Natalia Vélez is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and an incoming assistant professor at Princeton University beginning in fall 2023. Her research examines the cognitive foundations of human collaboration at two scales: how individuals learn from and about their collaborators, and how communities self-organize for effective collaboration. In her talk, Natalia will review recent evidence that suggests that humans are not merely passive recipients of social information—rather, we can actively interpret others’ observable actions by reasoning about the unobservable mental states that produced them. This reasoning process can be formalized as probabilistic inference over a generative model of other minds. The talk will provide an overview of probabilistic models of social learning and will highlight key methodological issues in applying these models to understand human behavior. Keywords: theory of mind, Bayesian models, social learning . Ralf Kurvers . kurvers[at]mpib-berlin.mpg[dot]de . Dr Ralf Kurvers is the head of the research area Collective Intelligence at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and an external PI at the Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster. His work focuses on social and collective decision-making in human and non-human animals, combining both empirical and modeling approaches to unravel the cognitive mechanisms underlying individuals’ decision making in social contexts, and emerging collective dynamics. In his lecture, he will introduce a social drift–diffusion model that his team developed to capture dynamics of information cascades among interactive agents. Testing the model in human groups, he will show that the model can recover the dynamics of human social decision-making process, accurately capturing how individuals integrate personal and social information dynamically over time. Keywords: collective dynamics, evidence accumulation, drift diffusion models . Stefano Palminteri . stefano.palminteri[at]gmail[dot]com . Dr Stefano Palminteri is the head of the Human Reinforcement Learning team, at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris. His team investigates the computational mechanisms underlying goal-directed and value-based behaviors through the lens of reinforcement learning theory. Most of his recent studies involve behavioral testing and computational modeling and identify biases in human reinforcement learning. In his lecture, he will talk about the computational bases of imitation in simple reinforcement learning contexts, contrasting two main hypothesis decision-biasing and value-shaping. Behavioral data were overall consistent with the value-shaping hypothesis, but also showed that participants downregulate imitation when disadvantageous. Such a meta-learning effect was efficiently captured by a similarity based modulation of the imitation rate. In a subsequent simulation study, his team investigated the normative properties (the “blessing”) of value-shaping imitation over decision-biasing and identified scenarios where it is detrimental (the “curse”).
