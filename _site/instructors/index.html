Her work focuses on revealing the mechanisms and consequences of collective behavior in biological and social systems. She is especially interested in understanding how animal groups make collective decisions and coordinate collective action, and in particular how these processes are affected by the social relationships between group members and the communication strategies they employ. Her group works across a range of study systems to tackle these questions, in close collaboration with researchers across a variety of disciplines. This lecture will give an overview of some of her work which aims to understand how animal and human groups make decisions in a group context, and how their interactions allow them to come to consensus on collective decisions. The talk will span a range of study species, and will highlight a few key methodological approaches that can be used to tackle these questions. <em>Keywords: consensus decisions; collective animal movement; tracking; step selection model</em></p></div></div><div class="staffer"> <img class="staffer-image" src="/assets/images/elena.png" alt="" /><div><h3 class="staffer-name"> <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/staff/elena-miu/">Elena Miu</a></h3><p><a href="mailto:elena_miu[at]eva.mpg[dot]de">elena_miu[at]eva.mpg[dot]de</a></p><p>Dr Elena Miu is a cultural evolutionist interested in understanding the dynamics of cultural change across domains.

Her research examines the cognitive foundations of human collaboration at two scales: how individuals learn from and about their collaborators, and how communities self-organize for effective collaboration. In her talk, Natalia will review recent evidence that suggests that humans are not merely passive recipients of social information—rather, we can actively interpret others’ observable actions by reasoning about the unobservable mental states that produced them. This reasoning process can be formalized as probabilistic inference over a generative model of other minds. The talk will provide an overview of probabilistic models of social learning and will highlight key methodological issues in applying these models to understand human behavior. <em>Keywords: theory of mind, Bayesian models, social learning</em></p></div></div><div class="staffer"> <img class="staffer-image" src="/assets/images/ralf.jpeg" alt="" /><div><h3 class="staffer-name"> <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/person/93403">Ralf Kurvers</a></h3><p><a href="mailto:kurvers[at]mpib-berlin.mpg[dot]de">kurvers[at]mpib-berlin.mpg[dot]de</a></p><p>Dr Ralf Kurvers is the head of the research area Collective Intelligence at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and an external PI at the Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster.

His team investigates the computational mechanisms underlying goal-directed and value-based behaviors through the lens of reinforcement learning theory. Most of his recent studies involve behavioral testing and computational modeling and identify biases in human reinforcement learning. In his lecture, he will talk about the computational bases of imitation in simple reinforcement learning contexts, contrasting two main hypothesis decision-biasing and value-shaping. Behavioral data were overall consistent with the value-shaping hypothesis, but also showed that participants downregulate imitation when disadvantageous. Such a meta-learning effect was efficiently captured by a similarity based modulation of the imitation rate. In a subsequent simulation study, his team investigated the normative properties (the “blessing”) of value-shaping imitation over decision-biasing and identified scenarios where it is detrimental (the “curse”). <em>Keywords: decision-biasing; value-shaping; reinforcement learning; imitation</em></p></div></div><h2 id="teaching-assistants"> <a href="#teaching-assistants" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="teaching-assistants"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Teaching Assistants</h2><div class="staffer"> <img class="staffer-image" src="/assets/images/alexandra.jpg" alt="" /><div><h3 class="staffer-name"> Alexandra Witt</h3><p><a href="mailto:alexandra.witt[at]uni-tuebingen[dot]de">alexandra.witt[at]uni-tuebingen[dot]de</a></p><p>Alexandra Witt received her B.Sc. in Psychology from the Technical University of Braunschweig.
