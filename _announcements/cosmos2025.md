## COSMOS 2025

Dear future COSMOnauts, we are taking a brief hiatus in 2024 while Wataru relocates to a [new position at Riken in Tokyo](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/faculty/btcc.cgd/index.html).

In the meantime, we will be writing a tutorial paper and looking for future funding sources to return in 2025. Stay tuned!
