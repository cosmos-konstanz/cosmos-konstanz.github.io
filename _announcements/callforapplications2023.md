## Apply by April 14th

We invite you to apply to the Computational Summer school on Modeling Social and collective behavior (COSMOS) taking place from **July 4th - July 7th 2023** in Konstanz, DE. 
COSMOS is designed to provide attendees (COSMOnauts) from diverse fields (e.g., psychology, economics, neuroscience, biology, computer science, etc...) and career stages (masters, PhD, postdoc, and junior PI) with the computational skills required to tackle emerging challenges in understanding social learning and collective behaviour. Taking advantage of the close collaboration networks and interdisciplinary expertise available at the Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour (CASCB) in Konstanz, COSMOS will invite leading researchers from diverse disciplines as guest [instructors](instructors) who will mentor attendees' own modelling projects during the School. In addition to providing hands-on instruction and mentorship for in-person attendees, we also publish openly accessible [teaching materials](materials)) and recorded talks. The goal of the students will be to develop a foundational understanding about how computational modeling can be a strong thread that unifies and advances the study of a wide range of social and collective phenomena.

Attendees will benefit from tutorials teaching the fundamentals of computational modeling in social and cultural settings, attend talks by leading researchers from around the world, and gain career advice during mentorship sessions. New for 2023, we will also have group projects, where participants can directly apply their new knowledge on a number of provided dataset under the supervision of our instructors.  

COSMOS 2023 is free to attend, and successful applications will be provided free shared accomodations. In addition, we will provide travel stipends for ~15 attendees on the basis of merit and need.  

## To apply, you will need to submit the following materials as a single pdf

1. One page cover letter describing your motivation to attend the summer school and how you think it will inform your research
1. Curriculum Vitae 
1. One letter of recommendation

You can submit your application by **April 14th**: [application portal](https://my.forms.app/form/64021072090187c47423a060){:target="_blank"}.
