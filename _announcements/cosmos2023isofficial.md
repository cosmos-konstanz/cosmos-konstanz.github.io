## Get set for COSMOS 2023!

We are excited to announce we have secured funding to host COSMOS again in 2023. This next iteration features a whole new set of [faculty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link instructors.md %}), improved hands-on projects working with real data, and much more! Again it will be free to attend, and we are in the process of securing funding for travel stipends and free accomodations for a number of successful applicants. 

More details will follow shortly, with the call for applications going out at the beginning of March with an April 14th deadline.
