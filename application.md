## Prerequisites
COSMOS is targeted towards attendees from diverse fields (e.g., psychology, economics, neuroscience, biology, computer science, etc) and career stages (master, PhD, postdoc, and junior PI). 

Participants should have a basic background knowledge in elementary statistics (e.g., probability theory) and programming in R in order to master the technical skills, but no prior experience with computational modeling is necessary.

## What we offer

Attendees will benefit from tutorials teaching the fundamentals of computational modeling in social and cultural settings, attend talks by leading researchers from around the world, and gain career advice during mentorship sessions. New for 2023, we will also have group projects, where participants can directly apply their new knowledge on a number of provided dataset under the supervision of our instructors.  

 
## Free to apply, free accomodations, and travel stipends
COSMOS 2023 is free to attend, and successful applications will be provided free shared accomodations. In addition, we will provide travel stipends for ~15 attendees on the basis of merit and need. 

## To apply, you will need to submit the following materials as a single pdf

1. One page cover letter describing your motivation to attend the summer school and how you think it will inform your research
1. Curriculum Vitae 
1. One letter of recommendation

You can submit your application by **April 14th**: [application portal](https://my.forms.app/form/64021072090187c47423a060){:target="_blank"}.
