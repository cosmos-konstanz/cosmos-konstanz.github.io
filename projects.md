## Group projects

You can find a more detailed overview about each project [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y2qfXVWEgXsvuHgZ7YbZrdSH-nGg-fyhg13a6hatKks/edit?usp=sharing).  

**P1: Wisdom or madness of crowds?**
(based on [Toyokawa, Whalen & Laland (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0518-x))

Investigate human choice behaviour in a three-armed bandit task to see when social learning is helpful and when it isn't.
- Beginner friendly
- Model code written in R
- Data and code are [here](https://github.com/WataruToyokawa/ToyokawaWhalenLaland2018)


**P2: Social learning in correlated environments**
(based on [Witt, Toyokawa, Lala, Gaissmaier & Wu (2023)](https://psyarxiv.com/c3fuq/))

Investigate how humans integrate social information when it is positively correlated in a multi-armed bandit task.
- Advanced
- Model code written in Python
- Data and code are [here](https://github.com/AlexandraWitt/socialGeneralization_COSMOS)


**P3: Learning other people's values based on the decisions they make**
(based on [Jern, Lucas & Kemp (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717301798?via%3Dihub))

Simulate inverse decision-making to understand an agent's prefrences.
- Beginner friendly
- No previous code to be used - choose your own programming language!
- Data are [here](https://github.com/alanjern/preferencelearning)


**P4: Tracking competence and preference inference from spatial navigation**
(based on [Jara-Ettinger, Schulz & Tenenbaum (2020)](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/docs/2020/cogpsych_NUC.pdf))

Simulate an artificial agent navigating an environment, and an observer inferring its preferences and competence. Compare how well this matches human ratings.
- Advanced
- Model code written in Python (or code your own MDP) 
- Data are [here](https://osf.io/uzs8r/) in the Data folder and code (if desired) is [here](https://github.com/julianje/Bishop)


**P5: Learning to communicate about shared procedural abstractions**
(based on [McCarthy*, Hawkins*, Wang, Holdaway & Fan (2021)](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/pdf/mccarthy_cogsci_2021b.pdf))

Replicate or expand on an analysis of how human participants effectively communicate in a physical assembly task.
- Beginner friendly or advanced, depending on whether you choose to replicate or expand
- Model code written in Python
- Data and code are [here](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/compositional_abstractions_tutorial)

 
**P6: Modelling algorithm-mediated social learning**
(inspired by [Acerbi (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y) and [Brady et al. (2023)](https://osf.io/yw5ah/))

Extend models of transmission biases including algorithmic-mediation (possibly using data from social media).
- Beginner friendly
- Model code written in R
- Code is [here](https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/)


**P7: Interplay between direct learning and social learning under uncertainty**
(based on [Zhang & Gl√§scher (2020)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb4159))

Work with an existing model of direct and social learning to predict human choices in an experiment or simulate agents.
- Advanced
- Model code written in Matlab, Stan, and R
- Data and code are [here](https://github.com/lei-zhang/SIT))


**P8: From pattern to process**
(based on Kandler, Fogarty & Karsdorp (2023))

Figure out what evolutionary process underlies the distribution of a population's cultural traits in five datasets. 
- Beginner friendly
- Model code written in R, Matlab, or Julia
- Data and code are [here](https://github.com/AlexandraWitt/PatternToProcess_COSMOS)

**P9: From pattern to process**
(based on [Sridhar et al. (2023)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0062))
