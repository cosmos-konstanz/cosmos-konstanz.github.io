Dr. Margaret Crofoot is a behavioral ecologist and evolutionary anthropologist interested in the evolution of social complexity. In her research, she combines observational methods and field-based experiments with emerging remote sensing technology, to reveal how group-living animals overcome conflicts of interest to achieve shared goals. She is particularly interested in how group-level traits emerge and the ways in which they shape the collective ecology of animalsâ€™ societies. Crofoot is currently a Director at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and Full Professor at the University of Konstanz.
