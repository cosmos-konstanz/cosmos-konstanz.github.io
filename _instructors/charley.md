Dr Charley Wu is the PI of the [Human and Machine Cognition Lab](https://www.hmc-lab.com) at the University of Tübingen, which is jointly funded by the Excellence Cluster "Machine Learning for Science" and the Tübingen AI Center. Using a combination of statistical and machine learning models, his team seeks to understand the cognitive shortcuts that allow humans to learn efficiently and behave intelligently, both individually and in groups. Drawing on an extensive background in computational modeling of behavior, Charley will provide students with a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of computational modeling in social settings.
