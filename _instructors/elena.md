Dr Elena Miu is a cultural evolutionist interested in understanding the dynamics of cultural change across domains. Her work focuses on understanding cumulative cultural evolution using theoretical models and large-scale data. In her lecture, she will introduce a unique model of cumulative cultural evolution that allows us to study the drivers and dynamics of this phenomenon, as well as talk about an agent-based model she developed to investigate how cognitive learning mechanisms interact with task difficulty to shape cultural transmission in a complex cultural task. *Keywords: Cumulative cultural evolution; innovation; recombination*
