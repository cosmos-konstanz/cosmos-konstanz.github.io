Dr Natalia Vélez is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and an incoming assistant professor at Princeton University beginning in fall 2023. Her research examines the cognitive foundations of human collaboration at two scales: how individuals learn from and about their collaborators, and how communities self-organize for effective collaboration. In her talk, Natalia will review recent evidence that suggests that humans are not merely passive recipients of social information—rather, we can actively interpret others' observable actions by reasoning about the unobservable mental states that produced them. This reasoning process can be formalized as probabilistic inference over a generative model of other minds. The talk will provide an overview of probabilistic models of social learning and will highlight key methodological issues in applying these models to understand human behavior. *Keywords: theory of mind, Bayesian models, social learning*
