Dr Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin is a research group leader jointly affiliated with the MPI-AB Ecology of Animal Societies Department and the University of Konstanz Biology Department. Her work focuses on revealing the mechanisms and consequences of collective behavior in biological and social systems. She is especially interested in understanding how animal groups make collective decisions and coordinate collective action, and in particular how these processes are affected by the social relationships between group members and the communication strategies they employ. Her group works across a range of study systems to tackle these questions, in close collaboration with researchers across a variety of disciplines. This lecture will give an overview of some of her work which aims to understand how animal and human groups make decisions in a group context, and how their interactions allow them to come to consensus on collective decisions. The talk will span a range of study species, and will highlight a few key methodological approaches that can be used to tackle these questions. *Keywords: consensus decisions; collective animal movement; tracking; step selection model*
