Dr Mark K Ho is a postdoctoral researcher in the Psychology and Computer Science departments at Princeton University. His research combines ideas from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence to examine how meta-reasoning---the capacity to reason about and influence mental states---shapes everyday thought, action, and interaction. In his lecture, he will address an outstanding question: How can we develop concise, interpretable models that integrate inference, decision-making, and interaction between multiple agents and their shared environment over time? He will discuss work that studies human planning and interactive communication by building on formalisms such as reinforcement learning, automated planning, and probabilistic programming. *Keywords: planning, communication, theory of mind, meta-cognition, reinforcement learning*
