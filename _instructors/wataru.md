Dr Wataru Toyokawa is a research scientist at the University of Konstanz, and is the PI of the “Collective Foraging and Social Search” project funded by CASCB. Using computational modelling and Bayesian statistical methods, coupled with real-time online behavioural experimentation, he is quantitatively approaching social behaviour and group dynamics, as well as their eco-evolutionary implications in humans and non-human animal societies.
