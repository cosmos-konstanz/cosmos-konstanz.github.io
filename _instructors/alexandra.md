Alexandra Witt received her B.Sc. in Psychology from the Technical University of Braunschweig. Striving to expand her understanding of human behaviour and cognition to its neural underpinnings, she subsequently joined the IMPRS Neuroscience in GÃ¶ttingen, which is where she received her MSc. During this time, she organized a statistics tutorial for her peers. For her PhD project in the [Human and Machine Cognition Lab](https://www.hmc-lab.com), she has been modelling social learning in both Python and R since she started in October 2021.
