Dr. Lei Zhang is an associate professor at the Centre for Human Brain Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. His research addresses the fundamental question of the “social brain” by studying the cognitive, computational, and neurobiological basis of social learning and decision-making in healthy individuals (across the lifespan), and in psychiatric disorders. In his lecture, he will talk about the implementation of a simple reinforcement learning model within the (hierarchical) Bayesian framework using Stan (http://mc-stan.org/).
