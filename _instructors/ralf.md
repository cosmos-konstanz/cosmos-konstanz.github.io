Dr Ralf Kurvers is the head of the research area Collective Intelligence at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and an external PI at the Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster. His work focuses on social and collective decision-making in human and non-human animals, combining both empirical and modeling approaches to unravel the cognitive mechanisms underlying individuals’ decision making in social contexts, and emerging collective dynamics. In his lecture, he will introduce a social drift–diffusion model that his team developed to capture dynamics of information cascades among interactive agents. Testing the model in human groups, he will show that the model can recover the dynamics of human social decision-making process, accurately capturing how individuals integrate personal and social information dynamically over time. *Keywords: collective dynamics, evidence accumulation, drift diffusion models*
