Vivek Hari Sridhar is a post-doctoral researcher in the Department for the Ecology of Animal Societies, at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. His interests lie in understanding fundamental principles that govern spatiotemporal computation in biological systems. To do this, he uses various techniques in computer vision and machine learning for data pre-processing and analysis. By taking inspiration from statistical physics and combining this with mathematical models and individual based simulations, he hopes to elucidate the link between the individual and the group at both generational and evolutionary timescales.
