Dr Stefano Palminteri is the head of the Human Reinforcement Learning team, at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris. His team investigates the computational mechanisms underlying goal-directed and value-based behaviors through the lens of reinforcement learning theory. Most of his recent studies involve behavioral testing and computational modeling and identify biases in human reinforcement learning. In his lecture, he will talk about the computational bases of imitation in simple reinforcement learning contexts, contrasting two main hypothesis decision-biasing and value-shaping. Behavioral data were overall consistent with the value-shaping hypothesis, but also showed that participants downregulate imitation when disadvantageous. Such a meta-learning effect was efficiently captured by a similarity based modulation of the imitation rate. In a subsequent simulation study, his team investigated the normative properties (the "blessing") of value-shaping imitation over decision-biasing and identified scenarios where it is detrimental (the "curse").  *Keywords: decision-biasing; value-shaping; reinforcement learning; imitation*
