Anne Kandler is a senior scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Her research is focused on generalising the theoretical foundations of cultural evolution to include features like complex trait architecture and population structure, or cognitive processes such as personal memory and explore their impact on the evolutionary process. She combines these theoretical approaches with empirical research by developing and applying suitable inference frameworks.
